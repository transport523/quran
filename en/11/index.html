<ol>

<li class="py-2">Alif Lam Ra [This is] a Scripture whose verses are perfected, then set out clearly, from One who is all wise, all aware</li>

<li class="py-2">[Say, Prophet], ‘Worship no one but God. I am sent to you from Him to warn and to give good news</li>

<li class="py-2">Ask your Lord for forgiveness, then turn back to Him. He will grant you wholesome enjoyment until an appointed time, and give His grace to everyone who has merit. But if you turn away, I fear you will have torment on a terrible Day</li>

<li class="py-2">it is to God that you will all return, and He has power over everything.’</li>

<li class="py-2">See how they [the disbelievers] wrap themselves up, to hide their feelings from Him. But even when they cover themselves with their clothes, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal: He knows well the innermost secrets of the heart</li>

<li class="py-2">There is not a creature that moves on earth whose provision is not His concern. He knows where it lives and its [final] resting place: it is all [there] in a clear record</li>

<li class="py-2">It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six Days––His rule extends over the waters too––so as to test which of you does best. Yet [Prophet], if you say to them, ‘You will be resurrected after death,’ the disbelievers are sure to answer, ‘This is clearly nothing but sorcery.’</li>

<li class="py-2">If We defer their punishment for a determined time, they are sure to say, ‘What is holding it back?’ But on the Day it comes upon them, nothing will divert it from them; what they mocked will be all around them</li>

<li class="py-2">How desperate and ungrateful man becomes when We let him taste Our mercy and then withhold it</li>

<li class="py-2">And if We let him taste mercy after some harm has touched him, he is sure to say, ‘Misfortune has gone away from me.’ He becomes exultant and boastful</li>

<li class="py-2">Not so those who are steadfast and do good deeds: they will have forgiveness and a great reward</li>

<li class="py-2">So [Prophet] are you going to abandon some part of what is revealed to you, and let your heart be oppressed by it, because they say, ‘Why is no treasure sent down to him? Why has no angel come with him?’? You are only there to warn; it is God who is in charge of everything</li>

<li class="py-2">If they say, ‘He has invented it himself,’ say, ‘Then produce ten invented suras like it, and call in whoever you can beside God, if you are truthful.’</li>

<li class="py-2">If they do not answer you, then you will all know that it is sent down containing knowledge from God, and that there is no god but Him. Then will you submit to Him</li>

<li class="py-2">If any desire [only] the life of this world with all its finery, We shall repay them in full in this life for their deeds- they will be given no less</li>

<li class="py-2">but such people will have nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: their work here will be fruitless and their deeds futile</li>

<li class="py-2">Can they be compared to those who have clear proof from their Lord, recited by a witness from Him, and before it the Book of Moses, as a guide and mercy? These people believe in it, whereas those groups that deny its truth are promised the Fire. So have no doubt about it [Prophet]: it is the Truth from your Lord, though most people do not believe so</li>

<li class="py-2">Who could do more wrong than someone who invents lies about God? Such people will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, ‘These are the ones that lied about their Lord.’ God’s rejection is the due of those who do such wrong</li>

<li class="py-2">who hinder others from God’s path, trying to make it crooked, and deny the life to come</li>

<li class="py-2">They will not escape on earth, and there will be no one other than God to protect them. Their punishment will be doubled. They could not hear, and they did not see</li>

<li class="py-2">It is they who will have lost their souls, and what they invented will have deserted them</li>

<li class="py-2">There is no doubt they will be the ones to lose most in the life to come</li>

<li class="py-2">But those who believed, did good deeds, and humbled themselves before their Lord will be companions in Paradise and there they will stay</li>

<li class="py-2">These two groups are like the blind and the deaf as compared with those who can see and hear well: can they be alike? How can you not take heed</li>

<li class="py-2">We sent Noah to his people to say, ‘I have come to you to give a clear warning</li>

<li class="py-2">worship no one but God. I fear you will have torment on a painful Day.’</li>

<li class="py-2">But the prominent disbelievers among his people said, ‘We can see that you are nothing but a mortal like ourselves, and it is clear to see that only the vilest among us follow you. We cannot see how you are any better than we are. In fact, we think you are a liar.’</li>

<li class="py-2">He said, ‘My people, think: if I did have a clear sign from my Lord, and He had given me grace of His own, though it was hidden from you, could we force you to accept it against your will</li>

<li class="py-2">My people, I ask no reward for it from you; my reward comes only from God. I will not drive away the faithful: they are sure to meet their Lord. I can see you are foolish</li>

<li class="py-2">My people, who could help me against God if I drove the faithful away? Will you not take heed</li>

<li class="py-2">I am not telling you that I hold God’s treasures, or have any knowledge of what is hidden, or that I am an angel. Nor do I say that God will not grant any good to those who are despised in your eyes: God Himself knows best what is in their souls. If I did this I would be one of the wrongdoers.’</li>

<li class="py-2">They said, ‘Noah! You have argued with us for too long. Bring down on us the punishment you threaten us with, if you are telling the truth.’</li>

<li class="py-2">He said, ‘It is God who will bring it down, if He wishes, and you will not be able to escape</li>

<li class="py-2">My advice will be no use to you if God wishes to leave you to your delusions: He is your Lord and to Him you will be returned.’</li>

<li class="py-2">If [these disbelievers] say, ‘He has made this up,’ say [Muhammad], ‘If I have made this up, I am responsible for my own crime, but I am innocent of the crimes you commit.’</li>

<li class="py-2">It was revealed to Noah, ‘None of your people will believe, other than those who have already done so, so do not be distressed by, what they do</li>

<li class="py-2">Build the Ark under Our [watchful] eyes and with Our inspiration. Do not plead with Me for those who have done evil- they will be drowned.’</li>

<li class="py-2">So he began to build the Ark, and whenever leaders of his people passed by, they laughed at him. He said, ‘You may scorn us now, but we will come to scorn you</li>

<li class="py-2">you will find out who will receive a humiliating punishment, and on whom a lasting suffering will descend.’</li>

<li class="py-2">When Our command came, and water gushed up out of the earth, We said, ‘Place on board this Ark a pair of each species, and your own family- except those against whom the sentence has already been passed- and those who have believed,’ though only a few believed with him</li>

<li class="py-2">He said, ‘Board the Ark. In the name of God it shall sail and anchor. My God is most forgiving and merciful.’</li>

<li class="py-2">It sailed with them on waves like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who stayed behind, ‘Come aboard with us, my son, do not stay with the disbelievers.’</li>

<li class="py-2">But he replied, ‘I will seek refuge on a mountain to save me from the water.’ Noah said, ‘Today there is no refuge from God’s command, except for those on whom He has mercy.’ The waves cut them off from each other and he was among the drowned</li>

<li class="py-2">Then it was said, ‘Earth, swallow up your water, and sky, hold back,’ and the water subsided, the command was fulfilled. The Ark settled on Mount Judi, and it was said, ‘Gone are those evildoing people!’</li>

<li class="py-2">Noah called out to his Lord, saying, ‘My Lord, my son was one of my family, though Your promise is true, and You are the most just of all judges.’</li>

<li class="py-2">God said, ‘Noah, he was not one of your family. What he did was not right. Do not ask Me for things you know nothing about. I am warning you not to be foolish.’</li>

<li class="py-2">He said, ‘My Lord, I take refuge with You from asking for things I know nothing about. If You do not forgive me, and have mercy on me, I shall be one of the losers.’</li>

<li class="py-2">And it was said, ‘Noah, descend in peace from Us, with blessings on you and on some of the communities that will spring from those who are with you. There will be others We will allow to enjoy life for a time, but then a painful punishment from Us will afflict them.’</li>

<li class="py-2">These accounts are part of what was beyond your knowledge [Muhammad]. We revealed them to you. Neither you nor your people knew them before now, so be patient: the future belongs to those who are aware of God</li>

<li class="py-2">To the Ad, We sent their brother, Hud. He said, ‘My people, worship God. You have no god other than Him; you are only making up lies</li>

<li class="py-2">I ask no reward from you, my people; my reward comes only from Him who created me. Why do you not use your reason</li>

<li class="py-2">My people, ask forgiveness from your Lord, and return to Him. He will send down for you rain in abundance from the sky, and give you extra strength. Do not turn away and be lost in your sins.’</li>

<li class="py-2">They replied, ‘Hud, you have not brought us any clear evidence. We will not forsake our gods on the strength of your word alone, nor will we believe in you</li>

<li class="py-2">All we can say is that one of our gods may have inflicted some harm on you.’ He said, ‘I call God to witness, and you too are my witnesses, that I disown those you set up as partners with God</li>

<li class="py-2">So plot against me, all of you, and give me no respite</li>

<li class="py-2">I put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord. There is no moving creature which He does not control. My Lord’s way is straight</li>

<li class="py-2">But if you turn away, then I have conveyed the message with which I was sent to you, and my Lord will bring along another people in your place. You cannot do Him any harm: it is my Lord who protects everything.’</li>

<li class="py-2">And so, when Our judgement came to pass, by Our grace We saved Hud and his fellow believers. We saved them from a severe punishment</li>

<li class="py-2">These were the Ad: they rejected their Lord’s signs, disobeyed His messengers, and followed the command of every obstinate tyrant</li>

<li class="py-2">They were rejected in this life and so they shall be on the Day of Judgement. Yes, the &#39;Ad denied their Lord- so away with the Ad, the people of Hud</li>

<li class="py-2">To the Thamud, We sent their brother, Salih. He said, ‘My people, worship God. You have no god other than Him. It was He who brought you into being from the earth and made you inhabit it, so ask forgiveness from Him, and turn back to Him: my Lord is near, and ready to answer.’</li>

<li class="py-2">They said, ‘Salih, We used to have such great hope in you. Will you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? We are in grave doubt about what you are asking us to do.’</li>

<li class="py-2">He said, ‘My people, just think: if I did have clear proof from my Lord, and if He had given me mercy of His own, who could protect me from God if I disobeyed Him? You would only make my loss greater</li>

<li class="py-2">My people, this camel belongs to God, a sign for you, so leave it to pasture on God’s earth and do not harm it, or you will soon be punished.’</li>

<li class="py-2">But they hamstrung it, so he said, ‘Enjoy life for another three days</li>

<li class="py-2">this warning will not prove false.’ And so, when Our command was fulfilled, by Our mercy We saved Salih and his fellow believers from the disgrace of that day. [Prophet], it is your Lord who is the Strong, the Mighty One</li>

<li class="py-2">The blast struck the evildoers and they lay dead in their homes</li>

<li class="py-2">as though they had never lived and flourished there. Yes, the Thamud denied their Lord- so away with the Thamud</li>

<li class="py-2">To Abraham Our messengers brought good news. They said, ‘Peace.’ He answered, ‘Peace,’ and without delay he brought in a roasted calf</li>

<li class="py-2">When he saw that their hands did not reach towards the meal, he found this strange and became afraid of them. But they said, ‘Do not be afraid. We have been sent against the people of Lot.’</li>

<li class="py-2">His wife was standing [nearby] and laughed. We gave her good news of Isaac and, after him, of Jacob</li>

<li class="py-2">She said, ‘Alas for me! How am I to bear a child when I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would be a strange thing!’</li>

<li class="py-2">They said, ‘Are you astonished at what God ordains? The grace of God and His blessings be upon you, people of this house! For He is worthy of all praise and glory.’</li>

<li class="py-2">Then, when the fear left Abraham and the good news came to him, he pleaded with Us for Lot’s people</li>

<li class="py-2">for Abraham was forbearing, tender-hearted, and devout</li>

<li class="py-2">‘Abraham, cease your pleading: what your Lord has ordained has come about; punishment is coming to them, which cannot be turned back.’</li>

<li class="py-2">And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was anxious for them, feeling powerless to protect them, and said, ‘This is a truly terrible day!’</li>

<li class="py-2">His people came rushing towards him; they used to commit foul deeds. He said, ‘My people, here are my daughters.They are more wholesome for you, so have some fear of God and do not disgrace me with my guests. Is there not a single right-minded man among you?’</li>

<li class="py-2">They said, ‘You know very well that we have no right to your daughters. You know very well what we want.’</li>

<li class="py-2">He said, ‘If only I had the strength to stop you or could rely on strong support!’</li>

<li class="py-2">They [the messengers] said, ‘Lot, we are your Lord’s messengers. They will not reach you. Leave with your household in the dead of night, and let none of you turn back. Only your wife will suffer the fate that befalls the others. Their appointed time is the morning: is the morning not near?’</li>

<li class="py-2">And so when what We had ordained came about, We turned their town upside down and rained down stones of baked clay on it, layer upon layer</li>

<li class="py-2">marked from your Lord. It is not far from the evildoers</li>

<li class="py-2">And to Midian, We sent their brother Shuayb. He said, ‘My people, worship God. You have no god other than Him. Do not give short measure nor short weight. I see you are prospering, but I fear you will have torment on an overwhelming Day</li>

<li class="py-2">My people, in fairness, give full measure and weight. Do not withhold from people things that are rightly theirs, and do not spread corruption in the land</li>

<li class="py-2">What lasts with God is best for you, if you are believers: I am not your keeper.’</li>

<li class="py-2">They said, ‘Shuayb, does your prayer tell you that we should abandon what our forefathers worshipped and refrain from doing whatever we please with our own property? Indeed you are a tolerant and sensible man.’</li>

<li class="py-2">He answered, ‘My people, can you not see? What if I am acting on clear evidence from my Lord? He Himself has given me good provision: I do not want to do what I am forbidding you to do, I only want to put things right as far as I can. I cannot succeed without God’s help: I trust in Him, and always turn to Him</li>

<li class="py-2">My people, do not let your opposition to me bring upon you a similar fate to the peoples of Noah or Hud or Salih; the people of Lot are not far away from you</li>

<li class="py-2">Ask forgiveness from your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance: my Lord is merciful and most loving.’</li>

<li class="py-2">They said, ‘Shuayb, we do not understand much of what you say, and we find you very weak in our midst. But for your family, we would have stoned you, for you have no great status among us.’</li>

<li class="py-2">He said, ‘My people, is my family stronger in your estimation than God? And have you put Him behind you? My Lord surrounds everything you do</li>

<li class="py-2">My people, do whatever is within your power, and I will do likewise. Soon you will know who will receive a disgraceful punishment and who is a liar. Watch out, and so will I.’</li>

<li class="py-2">When what We had ordained came about, in Our mercy We saved Shuayb and his fellow believers, but a mighty blast struck the wrongdoers. By morning they lay dead in their homes</li>

<li class="py-2">as if they had never lived and flourished there. Yes, away with the people of Midian, just like the Thamud</li>

<li class="py-2">We also sent Moses, with Our signs and clear authority</li>

<li class="py-2">to Pharaoh and his supporters, but they followed Pharaoh’s orders, and Pharaoh’s orders were misguided</li>

<li class="py-2">He will be at the forefront of his people on the Day of Resurrection, leading them down towards the Fire. What a foul drinking place to be led to</li>

<li class="py-2">They were pursued by God’s rejection in this life and will be on the Day of Resurrection, too. What a foul gift to be given</li>

<li class="py-2">We relate to you [Muhammad] such accounts of earlier towns: some of them are still standing; some have been mown down</li>

<li class="py-2">We did not wrong them; they wronged themselves. Their gods, which they called on beside God, were no use to them when what your Lord had ordained came about; they only increased their ruin</li>

<li class="py-2">Such is the punishment of your Lord for towns in the midst of their sins: His punishment is terrible and severe</li>

<li class="py-2">There truly is a sign in this for anyone who fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day in which all people will be gathered together, a Day for all to see</li>

<li class="py-2">We are delaying it only for a specified period</li>

<li class="py-2">and when that Day comes, no soul will speak except by His permission, and some of them will be wretched and some happy</li>

<li class="py-2">The wretched ones will be in the Fire, sighing and groaning</li>

<li class="py-2">there to remain for as long as the heavens and earth endure, unless your Lord wills otherwise: your Lord carries out whatever He wills</li>

<li class="py-2">As for those who have been blessed, they will be in Paradise, there to remain as long as the heavens and earth endure, unless your Lord wills otherwise- an unceasing gift</li>

<li class="py-2">[Prophet], have no doubt about what these people worship: it is merely what their fathers worshipped before them, and We shall certainly give them their share in full, without any reduction</li>

<li class="py-2">We gave Moses the Scripture before you, but differences arose about it and if it had not been for a prior word from your Lord, a decision would already have been made between them, though they are in grave doubt about it</li>

<li class="py-2">Your Lord will give everyone full due for whatever they have done: He is aware of everything they do</li>

<li class="py-2">So keep to the right course as you have been commanded, together with those who have turned to God with you. Do not overstep the limits, for He sees everything you do</li>

<li class="py-2">Do not rely on those who do evil, or the Fire may touch you, and then you will have no one to protect you from God, nor will you be helped</li>

<li class="py-2">[Prophet], keep up the prayer at both ends of the day, and during parts of the night, for good things drive bad away- this is a reminder for those who are aware</li>

<li class="py-2">Be steadfast: God does not let the rewards of those who do good go to waste</li>

<li class="py-2">If only there had been, among the generations before your time, people with a rem-nant of good sense, to forbid corruption on the earth! We saved only a few of them, while the unjust pursued the enjoyment of plenty, and persisted in sin</li>

<li class="py-2">Your Lord would not destroy any town without cause if its people were acting righteously</li>

<li class="py-2">If your Lord had pleased, He would have made all people a single community, but they continue to have their differences</li>

<li class="py-2">except those on whom your Lord has mercy- for He created them to be this way, and the word of your Lord is final: ‘I shall definitely fill Hell with both jinn and men.’</li>

<li class="py-2">So [Muhammad], We have told you the stories of the prophets to make your heart firm and in these accounts truth has come to you, as well as lessons and reminders for the believers</li>

<li class="py-2">Say to those who do not believe, ‘Do whatever you can: we too are doing what we can,’</li>

<li class="py-2">and ‘Wait: we too are waiting.’</li>

<li class="py-2">All that is hidden in the heavens and earth belongs to God, and all authority goes back to Him. So [Prophet], worship Him, and put your trust in Him: your Lord is never unaware of what you [people] are doing</li>
